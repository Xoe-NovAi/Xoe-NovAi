## 		Model Information 

### 	[ 		 	](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/embeddinggemma-300m-GGUF#description)

### 		Description 

EmbeddingGemma is a 300M parameter, state-of-the-art for its size,  open embedding model from Google, built from Gemma 3 (with T5Gemma  initialization) and the same research and technology used to create  Gemini models. EmbeddingGemma produces vector representations of text,  making it well-suited for search and retrieval tasks, including  classification, clustering, and semantic similarity search. This model  was trained with data in 100+ spoken languages.

The small size and on-device focus makes it possible to deploy in  environments with limited resources such as mobile phones, laptops, or  desktops, democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation for everyone.

### 		Inputs and outputs 

- **Input:**
  - Text string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be embedded
  - Maximum input context length of 2048 tokens
- **Output:**
  - Numerical vector representations of input text data
  - Output embedding dimension size of 768, with smaller options  available (512, 256, or 128) via Matryoshka Representation Learning  (MRL). MRL allows users to truncate the output embedding of size 768 to  their desired size and then re-normalize for efficient and accurate  representation.

### 	[ 		 	](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/embeddinggemma-300m-GGUF#usage)

### 		Usage 

These model weights are designed to be used with [Sentence Transformers](https://www.SBERT.net), using the [Gemma 3](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/gemma3) implementation from [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/index) as the backbone.

First install the Sentence Transformers library:

```bash
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

Then you can load this model and run inference.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

# Download from the ðŸ¤— Hub
model = SentenceTransformer("google/embeddinggemma-300m")

# Run inference with queries and documents
query = "Which planet is known as the Red Planet?"
documents = [
    "Venus is often called Earth's twin because of its similar size and proximity.",
    "Mars, known for its reddish appearance, is often referred to as the Red Planet.",
    "Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, has a prominent red spot.",
    "Saturn, famous for its rings, is sometimes mistaken for the Red Planet."
]
query_embeddings = model.encode_query(query)
document_embeddings = model.encode_document(documents)
print(query_embeddings.shape, document_embeddings.shape)
# (768,) (4, 768)

# Compute similarities to determine a ranking
similarities = model.similarity(query_embeddings, document_embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[0.3011, 0.6359, 0.4930, 0.4889]])
```

**NOTE**: EmbeddingGemma activations do not support `float16`. Please use `float32` or `bfloat16` as appropriate for your hardware.

### 		Training Dataset 

This model was trained on a dataset of text data that includes a wide variety of sources totaling approximately 320 billion tokens. Here are  the key components:

- **Web Documents**: A diverse collection of web text  ensures the model is exposed to a broad range of linguistic styles,  topics, and vocabulary. The training dataset includes content in over  100 languages.
- **Code and Technical Documents**: Exposing the model to code and technical documentation helps it learn the structure and  patterns of programming languages and specialized scientific content,  which improves its understanding of code and technical questions.
- **Synthetic and Task-Specific Data**: Synthetically  training data helps to teach the model specific skills. This includes  curated data for tasks like information retrieval, classification, and  sentiment analysis, which helps to fine-tune its performance for common  embedding applications.

The combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful multilingual embedding model that can handle a wide variety  of different tasks and data formats.

### 	[ 		 	](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/embeddinggemma-300m-GGUF#data-preprocessing)

### 		Data Preprocessing 

Here are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training data:

- CSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material)  filtering was applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure the exclusion of harmful and illegal content.
- Sensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models safe and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain personal information and other sensitive data from training sets.
- Additional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in line with [our policies](https://ai.google/static/documents/ai-responsibility-update-published-february-2025.pdf).

### 	[ 		 	](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/embeddinggemma-300m-GGUF#prompt-instructions)

### 		Prompt Instructions 

EmbeddingGemma can generate optimized embeddings for various use  casesâ€”such as document retrieval, question answering, and fact  verificationâ€”or for specific input typesâ€”either a query or a  documentâ€”using prompts that are prepended to the input strings. Query prompts follow the form `task: {task description} | query: ` where the task description varies by the use case, with the default task description being `search result`. Document-style prompts follow the form `title: {title | "none"} | text: ` where the title is either `none` (the default) or the actual title of the document. Note that providing a title, if available, will improve model performance for document  prompts but may require manual formatting.

Use the following prompts based on your use case and input data type. These may already be available in the EmbeddingGemma configuration in  your modeling framework of choice.

| **Use Case (task type enum)** | **Descriptions**                                             | **Recommended Prompt**                        |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| Retrieval (Query)             | Used to generate embeddings that are optimized for document search or information retrieval | task: search result \| query: {content}       |
| Retrieval (Document)          | title: {title \| "none"} \| text: {content}                  |                                               |
| Question Answering            | task: question answering \| query: {content}                 |                                               |

| Classification                | Used to generate embeddings that are optimized to classify texts according to preset labels | task: classification \| query: {content}      |
| Clustering                    | Used to generate embeddings that are optimized to cluster texts based on their similarities | task: clustering \| query: {content}          |
| Semantic Similarity           | Used to generate embeddings that are optimized to assess text similarity. This is not intended for retrieval use cases. | task: sentence similarity \| query: {content} |
| Code Retrieval                | Used to retrieve a code block based on a natural language query, such as *sort an array* or *reverse a linked list*. Embeddings of the code blocks are computed using retrieval_document. | task: code retrieval \| query: {content}      |
